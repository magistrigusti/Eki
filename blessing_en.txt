🌿 Children of light forge the cosmos. Stop! Do no harm! Creators strive to overcome the impossible. Do not wish ill, do no harm, do not commit acts that will destroy the future and harm all humanity. 🌿​

🔥 Creators forge space between reality and imagination. A free space from politics, murder, money, weapons, dictators, wars, drugs, and the vice of vanity. 🔥​

🛡️ Do not tarnish the pure intentions of the great creators with your desires. 🛡️​

P.S. Having seen this, forget. Forget what you saw, and forget the way here.
